# Game-Ai-development---CHESS


Abstract—Advanced deep reinforcement learning techniques allow developing of an AI agent that master-presents complex strategy games, such as Chess and Dota 2. Strategy games like Chess and Dota 2 present challenging problems, with their vast state spaces, long planning horizon, and dynamic environments. We propose an AI framework composed of a combination of a deep neural network with Monte Carlo Tree Search for efficient exploration and strategizing in the game Chess. For the game Dota 2, we explore multi-agent reinforcement learning over Prox- imal Policy Optimization using recurrent neural networks due to sequential decision-making coupled with real-time coordination requirements.
